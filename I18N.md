## How to handle internationalization
Actually, there is no direct support for the open source version of strapi, but there are a lot of possibilities: 
- https://strapi.gitee.io/documentation/3.0.0-alpha.x/concepts/concepts.html#internationalization-and-localization
- https://portal.productboard.com/strapi/1-roadmap/c/19-content-internationalization
- https://strapi.io/blog/monthly-update-november-2020

It depends on the preferred workflow.
